## About Me 



## Python Projects
1. [Histopathology Image Analysis with Deep Learning](https://github.com/juliusc1/Histopathology-Image-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning): This project attempts to use deep learning techniques to analyze and predict if patients are positive or negative for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) from histopathology images. I also compared the performance of three different models to determine which architecture produced the highest accuracy and AUC for IDC classification.

2. [Trasnfer Learning - Image Classification](https://github.com/juliusc1/Image-Classification): This project explores transfer learning techniques to train a deep learning–based image classifier for a 100-class dataset with limited training samples. The model is fine-tuned on pretrained architectures to achieve strong generalization despite the small dataset size.
