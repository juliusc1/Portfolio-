## About Me 



## Python Projects
1. [Histopathology Image Analysis with Deep Learning](https://github.com/juliusc1/Histopathology-Image-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning): This project attempts to use deep learning techniques to analyze and predict if patients are positive or negative for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) from histopathology images. I also compared the performance of three different models to determine which architecture produced the highest accuracy and AUC for IDC classification.

2. Trasnfer Learning - Image Classification
