## Julius Chang — Project Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and expertise in database management, data analysis, and data manipulation using Python and SQL. 


## About Me 

I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Biomolecular Engineering & Bioinformatics, concentrating in Bioinformatics. I’m passionate about applying data-driven methods to solve real-world problems, with career interests in data science and data analysis. I specialize in machine learning for biological and biomedical data, deep learning–based image analysis, and relational database design. I enjoy building end-to-end analytical workflows that extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

## Python Projects
1. [Histopathology Image Analysis with Deep Learning](https://github.com/juliusc1/Histopathology-Image-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning): This project attempts to use deep learning techniques to analyze and predict if patients are positive or negative for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) from histopathology images. I also compared the performance of three different models to determine which architecture produced the highest accuracy and AUC for IDC classification.

2. [Trasnfer Learning - Image Classification](https://github.com/juliusc1/Image-Classification): This project explores transfer learning techniques to train a deep learning–based image classifier for a 100-class dataset with limited training samples. The model is fine-tuned on pretrained architectures to achieve strong generalization despite the small dataset size.

## SQL Projects
1. [COVID-19 SQL Exploration & Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/juliusc1/COVID-19-Exploration): This project analyzes early COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations between 2020 and 2021. It applies analytical querying techniques—ranging from window functions to hierarchical aggregations—to extract meaningful insights from large, time-series datasets. A Tableau dashboard supplements the analysis by visualizing key metrics for interactive exploration.
